# Rainfall

They say the water falls from the sky
It's a question mark, it's a question mark
My heart is overdue a downpour
I thirst, I thirst for you

This crowd is starving for you darling
As they gather round to catch what ever falls
My heart is overdue a downpour
I thirst, I thirst for you

I wish you would rain on me
Rain on me
Rain from the heights, from the balcony
From the sky, from wherever you are.


*******************************
This drought it thirsting for you darling
As the crowd gathers round to catch what falls around you
Oh, it's always someone else
In the eyes, in the eyes, in the eyes of the holder
